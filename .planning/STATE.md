# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-19)

**Core value:** Given a short MIDI call played through an Operator preset, the model produces a response that feels like the user responding to themselves — and the active-learning loop demonstrably improves it over consecutive iterations.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Tokenizer & Ingest

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Tokenizer & Ingest)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-19 -- Phase 01 planning complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and per-phase CONTEXT.md files.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Train from scratch — no warm-start from prior checkpoint or MAESTRO pretrain
- Init: Vocab must reserve space for pitch bend / CC tokens so future additions don't break checkpoints
- Init: Mel encoder is jointly trained (not frozen pretrained); lives in the same checkpoint artifact
- Phase 1: Pitch vocab stays narrow (3 octaves, default C2–C5) — FM does the overtone work, not the MIDI model
- Phase 1: 32 quantized time bins, 16 velocity bins, explicit duration token (4 tokens/note)
- Phase 1: Mel = 22050 Hz, n_mels=128 / n_fft=2048 / hop=512, fixed-shape (96, 128)
