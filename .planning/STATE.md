# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-19)

**Core value:** Given a short MIDI call played through an Operator preset, the model produces a response that feels like the user responding to themselves — and the active-learning loop demonstrably improves it over consecutive iterations.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Tokenizer & Ingest

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Tokenizer & Ingest)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Train from scratch — no warm-start from prior checkpoint or MAESTRO pretrain
- Init: Vocab must reserve space for pitch bend / CC tokens so future additions don't break checkpoints
- Init: Mel encoder is jointly trained (not frozen pretrained); lives in the same checkpoint artifact
